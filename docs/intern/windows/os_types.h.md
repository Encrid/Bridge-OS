# src/windows/os_types.h

This header gives `include/os.h` its thread, its mutex, its event, its open folder, its watch and the state of its signals on Windows.
It defines `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN`, and includes `<stdatomic.h>`, `<windows.h>` and `include/os.h`. Each other file of `src/windows` includes this header.

## Constants

`OS_NAME_ROOM` is 256: the room for a name of 255 characters and its end.
The fields `whole` and `name` of `struct os_folder` keep that room for a name.

| Constant | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `OS_CHANGES_ROOM` | 65536: the bytes of the changes of a watch. The system also keeps the changes between two reads in a buffer of this size. |
| `OS_ABOVE_ROOM` | 1024: the bytes of the changes of the folder above a watch, which no function reads. |
| `OS_NAME_BYTES` | The bytes of the longest name of a watch in UTF-8, and its end: 3 bytes for each wide character of `OS_CHANGES_ROOM`. |

## Types

### struct os_thread

A thread that `os_thread_start` makes.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `handle` | The `HANDLE` of the thread. |
| `fn` | The function that the thread runs. |
| `arg` | The argument of `fn`. |

### struct os_mutex

A mutex: a critical section.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `section` | The `CRITICAL_SECTION`. |

### struct os_event

An event: an event object of Windows, which resets itself as a wait returns for it.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `handle` | The `HANDLE` of the event object. |

### struct os_folder

The open folder of `os_folder_open`, on Windows.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `find` | The handle of the search of `FindFirstFileExW`, or `INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE`. |
| `data` | The entry that the search found last. |
| `pending` | True while the first entry of the search is not given yet. |
| `whole` | The whole path of the folder in the form `\\?\`, with room after it for a backslash and a name. A path that has the form `\\.\` keeps it. |
| `bytes` | The memory of the file read last, or `nullptr` before the first read. |
| `name` | The last name that `os_folder_read_entry` gave, in UTF-8. |

### struct os_watch

The watch of `os_watch_start`, on Windows: `docs/intern/windows/folder_watch.c.md`, *The reads*.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `folder` | The handle of the folder, or `INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE`. |
| `above` | The handle of the folder above it, or `INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE` for a root. |
| `changes` | The `OVERLAPPED` of the read of `folder`. |
| `above_changes` | The `OVERLAPPED` of the read of `above`. |
| `final` | The path of the folder that `GetFinalPathNameByHandleW` gave at the start. |
| `again` | The room for that path at a later check, in the same block as `final`. |
| `depth` | The depth of the watch. |
| `at` | The byte of the next change in `records`. |
| `got` | The bytes of the changes in `records`. |
| `reading` | True while the read of `folder` runs. |
| `looking` | True while the read of `above` runs. |
| `stopped` | True after the watch stopped. |
| `records` | The changes of `folder`, as `FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION` records. |
| `above_records` | The changes of `above`. |
| `name` | The last name that `os_watch_take` gave, in UTF-8. |

### struct os_stop

The state of the signals: `docs/intern/windows/signal.c.md`, *The state*.

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `caught` | True after the first event. |
| `line` | The line that a thread writes at the first event. |
| `length` | The number of bytes of `line`. |

## Functions

The header declares the reads of a watch, which `src/windows/watch_read.c` defines.

| Function | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `os_read_changes(w)` | The read of `folder`. |
| `os_read_above(w)` | The read of `above`. |
| `os_is_in_place(w)` | The check of the path of `folder`. |
| `os_finish_read(w)` | The result of the read of `folder`. |
| `os_end_read(handle, overlapped)` | The end of a read at the stop. |
