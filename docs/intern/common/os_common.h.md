# src/common/os_common.h

This header declares the parts of `src/common` for the files of each system.
It includes `<stdint.h>` and `<stdio.h>`.

## Constants

`OS_AGAIN` is 3: the result of a step of a take that has no result yet.
The take of a watch does steps while a step gives `OS_AGAIN` and the watch did not stop. Then it gives the last result, or -1 after a stop.
No result of `os_watch_take` is 3.
